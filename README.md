# 🦉 Thank you for visiting
I'm an aspiring software developer who mainly works with Javascript and node.js. Although I orignially had a small amount of Python knowledge, I consider October 2021 to be the beginning of my coding journey when I started at [Northcoders bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/). I have graduated in February 2022 and I'm currently looking for employment while working on and perfecting my personal projects. You can view my portfolio [here](https://jamesgrannan.netlify.app/)

## 🛠️ Just some of my experience includes:
- 🎨 Front-end : React, React Native, HTML/CSS, Axios, Expo.
- 🗄️ Back-end: node.js, PSQL, Express, Firebase.
- 🔬 Testing : Jest, Supertest.

## 🏗️ What am I currently working on?
- Making my portfolio work on different screen sizes.
- Adding more endpoints to my api.
- Fixing the vote system on my app and improving the user experience.
