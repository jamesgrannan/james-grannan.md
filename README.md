I'm an aspiring software developer who mainly works with Javascript and node.js. Although I orignially had a small amount of Python knowledge, I consider October 2021 to be the beginning of my coding journey when I started at Northcoders bootcamp. I have graduated in February 2022 and I'm currently looking for empoyment and working on perfecting my personal projects. Just some of my experience includes:
Front-end: React, React Native, HTML/CSS, Axios, Expo
Back-end: node.js, PSQL, Express, Firebase
Testing: Jest, Supertest.

What am I currently working on?
- Creating a portfolio site.
- Adding more endpoints to my api.
- Fixing the vote system on my app and improving the user experience.
